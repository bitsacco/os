## Overview

Bitsacco OS is built using a microservice architecture to provide a scalable, resilient, and maintainable platform for Bitcoin financial services. The system is designed around domain-specific services that communicate via gRPC and REST APIs, with MongoDB as the primary data store and Redis for caching.

The architecture emphasizes:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains
- **Loose Coupling**: Services interact through well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance and graceful degradation

## Core Applications

The Bitsacco OS platform consists of the following core applications:

| Application | Description | Primary Responsibilities |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Admin** | Admin Dashboard | Frontend interface for platform administration |
| **Server** | Core Backend | Authentication, user management, business logic |
| **Swap** | Currency Exchange | BTC/KES conversion, FX rates, payment processing |

### Application Details

#### Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard provides a web interface for platform administration:

- User management and monitoring
- System metrics and dashboards
- Configuration management
- Support and operations tools

#### Server Application

The Server application consolidates core backend functionality:

- User authentication and authorization
- API routing and request handling
- Business logic for all domains (auth, chamas, notifications, shares, etc.)
- Metrics federation and monitoring
- WebSocket and gRPC communication

#### Swap Service

Handles currency exchange between Bitcoin and Kenyan Shillings (KES):

- Onramp (KES → BTC) transactions
- Offramp (BTC → KES) transactions
- FX rate management
- Third-party payment processor integration (IntaSend)

## Communication Patterns

Bitsacco OS implements several communication patterns:

### Synchronous Communication

- **gRPC**: Primary inter-service communication using Protocol Buffers
- **REST APIs**: External client communication and some inter-service calls

### Asynchronous Communication

- **Event-Driven**: Using event emitters for loosely coupled communication
- **Message Queues**: For durable asynchronous processing (using Redis)

### Protocol Buffers

Service contracts are defined using Protocol Buffers (.proto files) which:

- Provide type safety
- Enable efficient serialization
- Support versioning
- Generate client/server code

Example service interfaces are defined in the `/proto` directory, with files like:
- `auth.proto` - Authentication service
- `swap.proto` - Currency exchange service
- `shares.proto` - Shares management service

## Code Sharing

Common code is shared through:

### Common Library

The `@bitsacco/common` package contains:

- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for API and inter-service communication
- **Validators**: Input validation logic
- **Auth**: Authentication and authorization utilities
- **Database**: MongoDB schemas and repository patterns
- **Monitoring**: Metrics collection and OpenTelemetry integration
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Constants**: Configuration constants and enums
- **Fedimint**: Fedimint client integration
- **Events**: Event definitions and types

The common library enforces standardization across the platform and reduces duplication.

### Testing Library

The `@bitsacco/testing` package provides:

- Test utilities
- Mock services
- Testing fixtures
- Validation testing helpers

## Database

Bitsacco OS uses MongoDB as its primary database:

### Data Model

- **Document-Oriented**: Data stored in flexible, JSON-like documents
- **Schema Validation**: Using Mongoose schema definitions
- **Service Ownership**: Each service owns its data and schemas
- **References**: Using document references for relationships

### Repository Pattern

Data access is abstracted through repositories:

- **AbstractRepository**: Base repository class with CRUD operations
- **Service-Specific Repositories**: Extend the base repository with domain-specific methods
- **Schemas**: Mongoose schemas define document structure and validation

Example repository hierarchy:
```
AbstractRepository (common)
├── UserRepository (auth)
├── SharesRepository (shares)
├── WalletRepository (solowallet)
└── ChamaRepository (chama)
```

### Data Consistency

- **Transactions**: For operations requiring ACID properties
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Using version fields
- **Eventual Consistency**: For cross-service data

## Logging

Logging is implemented throughout the platform:

### Logger Module

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with standardized fields
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE
- **Context Enrichment**: Adding request IDs, user IDs, service names
- **Log Interceptor**: Automatically logs HTTP and gRPC requests/responses

### Log Content

Logs capture:
- Request/response details
- Error information and stack traces
- Performance metrics
- Business events
- System state changes

## Monitoring

The monitoring infrastructure provides comprehensive observability:

### Metrics Collection

- **OpenTelemetry**: For metrics instrumentation
- **Prometheus**: For metrics storage and querying
- **Grafana**: For visualization and alerting

### Standard Metrics

All services implement standard metrics:
- Operation counts (total, success, failure)
- Operation durations
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Service-Specific Metrics

Domain-specific metrics include:
- **Auth**: Login attempts, registration success, token operations
- **Swap**: Transaction volumes, currency rates, processing times
- **Shares**: Share transactions, ownership distribution
- **Chama**: Contribution metrics, distribution patterns
- **LNURL**: Lightning Network operation metrics

### Metric Implementation

Metrics are implemented using:
- **MetricsService**: Base service for standard metrics
- **OperationMetricsService**: For tracking operation outcomes
- **Service-Specific Services**: Extending the base classes for domain metrics

The metrics system is designed for:
- **Scalability**: Handles high-volume metric collection
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new metrics
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal performance impact

## Deployment

Bitsacco OS supports multiple deployment models:

### Container Orchestration

- **Docker Compose**: For development and testing
- **Kubernetes**: For production deployment (not included in the codebase)

### Infrastructure Components

The infrastructure includes:
- **MongoDB**: Document database
- **Redis**: Caching and message queuing
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Monitoring dashboards
- **Fedimint Client**: Federated mint client for Bitcoin operations

### Configuration

Services are configured via:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Secrets management (in production)

### Scaling

The architecture supports:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more service instances
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing resources per instance
- **Database Sharding**: For large data volumes
- **Load Balancing**: For distributing traffic

## Security

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: For secure authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Controlling resource access
- **OTP Verification**: For secure operations

### Communication Security

- **TLS/SSL**: Encrypted communications
- **API Keys**: For service-to-service authentication
- **Input Validation**: Preventing injection attacks

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: For sensitive data at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Tracking access and changes
- **Secure Defaults**: Minimizing attack surface

### Bitcoin Security

- **Fedimint Integration**: Federated custody model
- **Multi-signature**: For high-value operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse

The security model follows defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of protection.
